						About Me
					</h2>
					
					<p>
				
						My name is Lyndon Forbes Bowen Jr and I was born on July 29th 1999 in Newbern, North Carolina, in Craven County Regional hospital. Currently I am 15 years of age and I live in Durham, North Carolina.  Some of my hobbies include: writing, science, computing and philosophy. I am enrolled in J.D. Clement Early College High School and North Carolina Central University. I am also part of the National Honors Society and the Founder/President of the computer club at JD Clement. I enjoy learning and I tackle most of all the opportunities that come my way. As a person I am focused and assiduous especially when it comes to completing the task at hand. However, I also have a lovable side and strong sense of humor. My current aspirations for the future include me obtaining a double major in computational science and bioengineering, starting my own corporation, and publishing my various novels and poetry. Ever since I was a little boy I have loved asking the questions why? Or how? This obscure curiosity has poured over into my adolescent years. This passion has pushed me to take hold of the scientific, computational and philosophical communities. I view these fields as a passion and I would simply not be the person I am today without their overwhelming influence. I believe that it is important to be able to think for yourself. To be able to sit back and critically analyze our society and instigate change and I hope to change the world for the better. Thus with the creation of this website I hope to show the world my talents. Also I want to properly demonstrate the skills and abilities that I will acquired during my time at The Shodor Education Foundation. I hope that this website would assist the thinkers and the inovators that visit as well as making a step in the right direction for making our world a better place, for everyone.
