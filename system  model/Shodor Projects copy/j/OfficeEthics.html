					<h1> Office Ethics <h1>
					
					<p> In life whenever you are tasked with completing a task in an allotted time frame it is important to properly delegate and divide the amount of information and work that is required to be done. 
A commonly recurring motif in this scenario are the personal problems that the participants encounter. The key to fixing this problem can be summed up in three main points. First of all a plan needs to be set in motion to properly manage time. Second, each member of the team needs to be delegated a position based on their expertise and professional value. Last of all deadlines need to be met and while in is good to be friends with your co workers that must not affect your professional success.
The first step is simple and easy. The leader of the team which in this case would be me needs to set deadlines,benchmarks and objectives that span until the final deadline to ensure quality work. My team member are working 50 to 60 hours of week already. So what this means is that we must maximize the time that we have and put forth our best effort. If the working environment becomes more organized the employees will be come less stressed which would allow them to inturn put forth their maximum effort. This is how I would properly manage the RED teams job.
This delegation of roles is a very tricky and tedious task. Although your co workers are your friends you must be able to look past that and not delegate positions based on bias but instead and technical ability. I as a leader in this scenario must be able to delegate responsibilities in a professional manner. If the coworker is dissatisfied with their position and they have no justifiable claim then they are obviously not ready for the professional environment and its demands. As in the case of Tory he would need to be professionally approached and we would discuss his problems with money and other solutions that would inturn not affect his performance of the job. Other than that his skills as a programer are highly needed and possibly as a solution he could work harder on our project for a bonus. 
The last solution to the scenario would be maintaining a professional and productive environment. This would allow healthy friendships but the gaol at hand would always come first. This means that any personal preferences, animosity or contempt needs to be let outside the work environment. This would mean that everyone would be responsible for their own work if not they would need to leave the pre established professional environment.
I believe that along with these simple and practical changes that the scenarios outcome would be up to par with the other teams.  I also think that along with the three step plan we would achieve our goal with precision and accuracy. This is how I would solve this scenario that I have been presented with.
