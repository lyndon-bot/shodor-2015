				<h2>
				Blog: Oct. 4th 2014
				</h2>
				
				<p>
				I learned that I needed to work on my time management skills as well as my presentation skills. I am most exited about learning about the computer programing concepts.Today I presented the material the I had despite the fact that the material was not perfected fully to my liking.I am also happy about how well me and my parter worked together. I have learned from today that Time management is very important because it is very easy to procrastinate. Also I spent a lot of time looking for help when I should have tried to problem solve on my own. However, I still view today as a learning experience I and I do not regret any of my choices but I do think that I should have made wiser decisions.
