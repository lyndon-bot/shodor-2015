				<p>
				I learned about modeling today, which actually turned out to be fun and interesting. I noticed that the modeling agent we were using which was called agent sheets had many similarities with java programing. I enjoyed modeling because it was something new that I had never done before. I quickly fell in love with it and I look forward to learning more about modeling with Agent sheets. Vensim for me was very easy and it was quickly mastered by me. However, Agent sheets is something that may take quite a while for me to fully master. I enjoyed today for the mast part and I look forward to learning more about system modeling and computer programing.
